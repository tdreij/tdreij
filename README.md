- 👋 Hi, I’m @tdreij
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more programming and coding in general.
 I'm considering switching careers, and even if I end up not doing that,
I enjoy coding in general and it's a useful skill to have! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, mostly, as well as adjacent skills such as
using Sublime Text, bash, and GitHub, but I'm still dipping my toes so
I might branch out in to other languages and things. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on.. nothing, currently. Perhaps something simple
with fellow students in the near future but I'm not quite that comfortable coding yet.
Soon, though, who knows! I do have a CodeWars account,
 so I am starting to read other people's code and comments. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm currently not looking to collaborate or talk to people directly.
